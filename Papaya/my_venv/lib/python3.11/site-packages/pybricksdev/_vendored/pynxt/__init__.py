PyNXT is a Python module that enables developers to communicate with
Lego Mindstorms NXT bricks at a low level. It currently facilitates
scanning the USB chain for a NXT brick and implements the SAM-BA
bootloader communication protocol. It comes with two utilities, fwflash
and fwexec, which can be used to write a firmware to either flash memory
or RAM, and execute it from there.
